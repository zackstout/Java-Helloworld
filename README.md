# Hello world!
Getting started with Java.

## Getting started
Note that you'll need to install a Java Runtime Environment and a Java Developer Kit (I used one that's integrated with the IDE [NetBeans](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk-netbeans-jsp-142931.html)) in order to run this code from the terminal.

To run it, use ```java HelloWorld```. If you make any changes, compile the code before running it with ```javac HelloWorld.java```.
